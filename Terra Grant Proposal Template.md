## Project Overview

Flappy Bird on Terra will bring back the legendary Flappy Bird mobile game, (with the [gaming rights IP](https://trademarks.justia.com/861/88/flappy-86188824.html) - to now be held in the Terra Treasury as an NFT), for a buildout in Web3 - combining NFT’s, play-to-earn [P2E] gaming mechanics and the addictive core loop of the original title as a casual gaming mobile dAPP.


### Overview

The original Flappy Bird, as released in 2013, is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the character (a bird), which moves persistently to the right. Players are tasked with navigating the bird through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes would award the player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ended the gameplay. 

Due to its addictive core loop, ease of access (mobile-no active internet required), and frustratingly difficult gameplay, Flappy became a cult classic, generating 50 million downloads by January 2014, making it one of the top free games on the Android and iOS app stores.
With our ownership of the Flappy Bird IP in hand, we aim to recapture the magic of the original Flappy Bird brand, while adding the best that Web 3.0 has to offer.

Flappy Bird on Terra will utilize Anchor’s API to leverage it’s yield earning components, transforming Flappy Bird into a Web 3.0 level progression game allowing for advancement, achievements, NFT’s and P2E mechanics (an asymmetric reward distribution based on player progress).

We have decided to relaunch the title now, having owned the Flappy Bird IP since 2018 but not finding the proper timing/ecosystem to execute on our vision until now. With so many clones and knockoffs of Flappy - in name and game-play, reintroduction of the original brand only became captivating with the P2E revolution taking place in Web 3.0.  Terra, through the Anchor protocol, is uniquely positioned to support the first casual P2E game in the space, differentiated from all the current role playing and NFT games currently saturating the space. We see the reintroduction of the Flappy Bird brand into Web 3.0 as a major win for casual/social gaming and a bridge between mobile (Web 2.0) and P2E (Web 3.0)

## Development Status

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or RFP (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from Terra
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Terra. We *recommend* that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. *Treat it as a contract*; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested *per milestone*.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish under the terms of the license of the respective project and that you highlight this fact in your milestone documentation and in the source code if applicable! Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Amount of payment in USD for the whole project. The total amount of funding *needs to be below $30k for initial grants* and $100k for follow-up grants. (e.g. 12,000 USD). This and the costs for each milestone need to be in USD; if the grant is paid out in Luna, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Terra Modules

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:** 2
- **Costs:** 8,000 USD
